    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Pollution is the introduction of any harmful material into the environment. It can be anything from chemicals, to plastic, or even gases.There is about 5.25 trillion pieces of trash in the ocean,
      with a combined weight of approximately 269,000 tons. Not only does the pollution the ocean directly harm the marine life, the food and rescources we take <i>from the ocean</i> are also affected by plastic. </p>

    <p>The picture on the right is an image of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive collection of trash in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be about 1.6 million square kilometers, and is made up of about 80,000
      metric tons of <i>plastic.</i></p>

    <h1>Causes</h1>
    <p>The most obvious cause of pollution is the massive amount of trash that gets thrown in the water every year. But as mentiened earlier, there's more than one kind of pollution. In a certain sense, pollution has an impact on <i>every</i> aspect of our life.Below are the causes of pollution that occur the most.</p>
    <div class="List of causes">
      <ul>
        <li>Plastic Waste, causesd littering, and waste from big companies, like</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Pepsi</li>
            <li>Nestle</li> 
            <li>Coca-cola</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Industrial Wastewater</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Which is basically the liquids that factories and other industrial facilities release as a byproduct of their operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Oil Spills</li>
          <ul>
          <li>which is when large amounts of liquid petroleum hydrocarbon is spilled, usually into the ocean </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Sewage and Wastewater</li>
        <li>Agricultural Runoff</li>
        <li>Atmospheric Deposition</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Which is the process by which pollutants and other substances are transported from the atmosphere and deposited onto the Earth's surface</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

    <h1>What Can I do About This?</h1>
    <p>That's the right question. All that's left is for 8 billion more people to ask the same thing.The most obvious thing that can be done is recycling. Apart from that, minimizing energy usage is another huge way to help fight pollution. Being mindfull of the energy you use can look like all sorts of things, from turning off the lights when you're not there to riding a bike to work instead of driving your car.<br></p>
    <p>(Recycling is when waste material like plastics, paper, cardboard, or metal are repurposed to create something new, like a new water bottle, or a vase)</p>

    <h4>As of right now, awareness has:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Saved 193 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2018</p></li>
      <li><p>Saved 17 trees every time ONE piece of paper is recycled</p></li>
      <li><p>Reduced air pollution by 86%</p></li>
